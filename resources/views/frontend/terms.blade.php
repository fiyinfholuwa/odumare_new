                                <p>
								Students have the flexibility to choose the payment plan that suits them best. We offer a three-installment payment option for the course fee.

                                    The payment plan consists of three installments. The first payment is due at the time of enrollment and amounts to 40% of the total course fee. The second installment of 30% is due in the second month, and the third installment of 30% due in the third month.

                                </p>

                                <h2>Payment Due Dates</h2>

								Enrollment in the course is considered confirmed once the first installment payment has been received and processed.
                                </p>

                                <h2>Non-Refundable</h2>
                                <p>
